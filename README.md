My performance task.
Woof! I finally managed to complete it. After days of working and trying to get this game to work, I finally did it. With a few days spent just learning and other days using trial and error, I have managed to conjure up a game that is, to me, quite fun. I have always been fond of playing typing games, as they satisfy me. So I figured, why not make one? The project that followed the though will be enjoyable to all who decide to pick up and play.
